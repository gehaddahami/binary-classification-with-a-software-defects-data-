# binary-classification-with-a-software-defects-data-
This project has been done as part of a competition in Kaggle and for learning purposes, I have redone the project from scratch. 

The dataset for this project (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Software Defect Dataset. 
Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, 
both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
